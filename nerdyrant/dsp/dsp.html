    <h2>What is DSP?</h2>
      <p>In the real world... there are analog signals, that are in continuous time domain. Modern computers cannot process continuous data -- atleast not yet, so we convert the signal from continuous-time domain into discrete-time domain -- and our signal now becomes a <b>digital signal.</b> This is achieved using an Analog-to-Digital Converter (which I will discuss later in the blog). <br> <br>
        Digital Signal Processing is an umbrella term used for mathematical algorithms and tools --- that computers use --- to analyze and process real world signals. So in layman terms, this is pure math! A perfect place to begin my journey to <em><b>" mathematical maturity "</b></em>.</p>

      <h3>The Fundamentals of Signal Processing</h3>
      <p>To fully understand and grasp this course, I am going to re-visit (briefly) the fundamentals and pre-requisites of signal processing.    </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Discrete Time Signals</li>
         Defined only at specific, distinct points in time, rather than continuously over time. Basically it's a sequence of numbers representing the signal's values at those discrete points. These signals can be obtained by sampling a continuous time signal or can be inherently discrete.
