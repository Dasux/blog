      <h2>Purpose of this page?</h2>
      Engineering is tedious, and majoring in Electronics, doesn't make it any more easier. Eventually, there are a few concepts / corollaries / lemmas that I find difficult to wrap my head around. Now, like most of you, I <em>could</em> just ask ChatGPT, but I don’t think that’s a good long-term habit—especially when I’ve got the luxury of time. <br> 

      If you haven't guessed already, the purpose of this page, is to achieve what most mathematicians call <em><b>"mathematical maturity"</b></em>. And that is NOT something you can achieve by debating with ChatGPT. <br>

      <h2>Mathematical Maturity</h2>
      <p>In simple terms, it is a mix of experience, intuition and understanding that comes from deep exposure to mathematical concepts and problems. Atleast that's the definition given by google:) In my own words, it is the point in life, when you starting cooking math, like it owes you money! </p>

      <p>In this blog, I have tried to articulate my personal thought process while understanding the concepts. I am not a mathematician, so don't judge me!</p>
