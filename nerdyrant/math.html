      Engineering is tedious, and majoring in Electronics, doesn't make it any more easier. Eventually, there are a few concepts/ corollaries/ lemmas... that I find difficult to wrap my head around. Now, like most of you, I <em>could</em> just ask ChatGPT, but I don’t think that’s a good long-term habit—especially when I’ve got the luxury of time. <br> <br>

      If you haven't guessed already, the purpose of this page, is to achieve what most mathematicians call <em><b>"mathematical maturity"</b></em>. And that is NOT something you can achieve by debating with ChatGPT. <br> <br>

      Most of these rants will look like short notes, straight from the text.. and that is part of what I'm trying to do here. Create short notes for future reference, with my own little commentaries in between. I have tried, to the best of my abilities, to display my train of thoughts when studying these subjects. I am not a mathematician, so don't judge me as one, or do.. doesn't matter. I love healthy criticism, you can write to me at anirbandas2004@gmail.com
