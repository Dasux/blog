      <p>For as long as I can remember, life has always been easy going for me. I didn't have to worry about doing something meaningful up until I graduated 10th grade from ICSE. COVID-19 just started back then, it was early March, 2020. I had to choose between staying back at my former school, or change schools, since I couldn't go back there anyways. Quarantine and lockdown were setting all over the country, and the globe. So I did what most of my other colleagues did -- change schools. </p>
      <p>I got enrolled to a local school in my hometown for the next two years; +2. But the next two years were nothing like I could have expected. I knew I needed a purpose. 11th & 12th grade pretty much decide what you're gonna do for the most of your academic life. And I was aware of that, but all I lacked was <b>clarity.</b> For me, an average student, opting for science, JEE seemed like the next big thing (<em>along with 11 Lakh other aspirants across India</em>). And so I began prepping for JEE like anyone else would. And if you've ever prepared for a competitive exam of that magnitude, you'd know right away the bullshit I was stepping into. JEE isn't your regular <em>"strawberry-cupcake class test"</em>, it is .... tedious. </p>
      <p>And that is precisely when I lost it. I lost clarity the moment I'd decided to prep for JEE. I'm not downplaying my shortcommings or whining about my lack of competence, I'm just trying to put a finger on what happened where. And if you're reading this, you should know, not everyone gets to taste the nectar of success. <em>Pretty cheesy line (ik)</em>... But it is what it is. I've longed for clarity for as long as I can remember. I never really knew what I wanted to do in life. And a part of me is glad about it, I have this feeling that maybe, just maybe ... unexpected things will come my way. But thats just delusion speaking at this point. Without a goal, I'm as good as dead.</p>
      <p>It’s wild how silence can be so loud. Those early days of the pandemic — with the streets empty and my inbox full of motivational quotes — felt less like a pause and more like a void. I wasn’t choosing a school. I was choosing what kind of adult I might become. And even that felt too big, too soon. In hindsight, I don’t think I was choosing between schools. I was choosing between the comfort of what I knew, and the discomfort of becoming someone new. And the thing about discomfort is… it doesn't ask for permission to change you. It just does. I think, deep down, I was hoping the world would freeze just long enough for me to catch up. But time, even in lockdown, never really stops — it just changes shape. And while everything around me stood still, I could feel this pressure building, like I had to emerge from it all with some kind of 'purpose' or 'plan' or 'newfound clarity'. Spoiler alert: I didn’t. I just floated through it, like most of us did, pretending we were fine while quietly falling apart in invisible ways.</p>
