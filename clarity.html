      <p>Everyone talks about finding clarity like it's some hidden shrine on a mountain. But what they don't tell you is that most days, it's just fog with better lighting. I've been chasing clarity for as long as I knew the meaning of the word, and I still haven't found it yet. And you know what the problem is? It's this mentality, that clarity is a destination, when it's actually the entire road you take to your goals. </p>
      <p>People expect clarity to be tidy, like something you can write in a planner. But the truth is, most of it comes thru heartbreaks, failures, and caffeine-fueled sirals at 3am. </p>
