      <p>Everyone talks about finding clarity like it's some hidden shrine on a mountain. But what they don't tell you is that most days, it's just fog with better lighting. I've been chasing clarity for as long as I knew the meaning of the word, and I still haven't found it yet. And you know what the problem is? It's this mentality, that clarity is a destination, when it's actually the entire road you take to your goals. </p>
      <p>People expect clarity to be tidy, like something you can write in a planner. But the truth is, most of it comes thru heartbreaks, failures, and caffeine-fueled spirals at 3am. 
      Maybe, just maybe, I was never meant to find it. Maybe all of this was designed to be lived the way it is; maybe the entire concept of chasing clarity and purpose is a waste of time. I could go on for hours venting out my nihilism, but that wouldn't get me to a conclusion now would it?
      Maybe, this pursuit of clarity, made me lose the love of my life. I dont know if any of this makes any sense to you, and I don't care frankly. You didn't come here to make sense out of life. You came here, maybe cause you stumbled upon this site. Maybe I shared the link to you (<em>which would be very... very rare</em>), 
      but you didn't come here to make sense out of things. Chances are, you relate to my senseless rant. Chances are, you too are seeking clarity. If you do find it, let me know. You know where to find me.</p>
