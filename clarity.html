      <p style="color:gray; font-size:10pt;">May 11, 2025</p>
      <p>For as long as I can remember, life has always been easy going for me. I didn't have to worry about doing something meaningful up until I graduated 10th grade from ICSE. COVID-19 just started back then, it was early March, 2020. I had to choose between staying back at my former school, and changing schools, since I couldn't go back there anyways. Quarantine and lockdown were setting all over the country, and the globe. So I did what most of my other colleagues did -- change schools. </p>
      <p>I got enrolled to a local school in my hometown for the next two years; +2. But the next two years were nothing like I could have expected. I knew I needed a purpose. 11th & 12th grade pretty much decide what you're gonna do for the most of your academic life. And I was aware of that, but all I lacked was <b>clarity.</b> For me -- an average student opting for science, JEE seemed like the next big thing (<em>along with 11 Lakh other aspirants across India</em>). And so I began prepping for JEE like anyone else would. And if you've ever prepared for a competitive exam of that magnitude, you'd know right away the bullshit I was stepping into. JEE isn't your regular <em>"strawberry-cupcake class test"</em>, it is .... tedious. </p>
      <p>And that is precisely when I lost it. I lost clarity the moment I'd decided to prep for JEE. I'm not downplaying my shortcomings or whining about my lack of competence, I'm just trying to put a finger on what happened where. And if you're reading this, you should know, not everyone gets to taste the nectar of success. <em>Pretty cheesy line (ik)</em>... But it is what it is. I've longed for clarity for as long as I can remember. I never really knew what I wanted to do in life, and a part of me is glad about it. I have this feeling that maybe, just maybe ... unexpected things will come my way. But that's just delusion speaking at this point. Without a goal, I'm as good as dead.</p>
      <p>It’s wild how silence can be so loud. Those early days of the pandemic — with the streets empty and my inbox full of motivational quotes — felt less like a pause and more like a void. In hindsight, I don’t think I was choosing between schools. I was choosing between the comfort of what I knew, and the discomfort of becoming someone new. And the thing about discomfort is… it doesn't ask for permission to change you. It just does. I think, deep down, I was hoping the world would freeze just long enough for me to catch up. But time, even in lockdown, never really stops — it just changes shape. And while everything around me stood still, I could feel this pressure building, like I had to emerge from it all with some kind of 'purpose' or 'plan' or 'newfound clarity'. Spoiler alert: I didn’t. I just floated through it, like most of us did, pretending we were fine while quietly falling apart in invisible ways.</p>
      <p>Everyone talks about finding clarity like it's some hidden shrine on a mountain. But what they don't tell you is that most days, it's just fog with better lighting. I've been chasing clarity for as long as I knew the meaning of the word, and I still haven't found it yet. And you know what the problem is? It's this mentality, that clarity is a destination, when it's actually the entire road you take to your goals.</p>
      
      <p>People expect clarity to be tidy, like something you can write in a planner. But the truth is, most of it comes thru heartbreaks, failures, and caffeine-fueled spirals at 3am. Maybe, just maybe, I was never meant to find it. Maybe all of this was designed to be lived the way it is; maybe the entire concept of chasing clarity and purpose is a waste of time. I could go on for hours venting out my nihilism, but that wouldn't get me to a conclusion now would it? Maybe, this pursuit of clarity, made me lose the love of my life. I dont know if any of this makes any sense to you, and I don't care frankly. You didn't come here to make sense out of life. You came here, maybe cause you stumbled upon this site. Maybe I shared the link with you (<em>which would be very... very rare</em>), but you didn't come here to make sense out of things. Chances are, you relate to my senseless rant. Chances are, you too are seeking clarity. If you do find it, let me know. You know where to find me :)</p>

      <p>Maybe clarity isn’t a moment of sudden understanding — maybe it’s just a series of quiet, stubborn decisions made in the middle of confusion. Maybe it’s the voice that tells you to keep moving, even when your feet are dragging through emotional molasses. No one tells you that clarity can be ugly. That it can look like giving up on a dream that no longer feels like yours. That it might mean walking away from someone you thought you'd grow old with. That sometimes, it's choosing yourself in the least aesthetic, least Instagrammable way possible. I used to think clarity would come wrapped in peace. But lately, I think it comes with discomfort — with crying in showers, writing cryptic notes to yourself, and waking up to the realization that you’ve outgrown who you used to be. And if that’s the case, maybe I’ve been closer to clarity than I thought. Maybe you have too.</p>

      <p>But let’s be honest — clarity is a scam. It’s the adult version of Santa Claus. A lie sold to us in productivity podcasts and Pinterest quotes. Everyone acts like it’s this shining light at the end of the tunnel, but what if the light’s just another train coming to hit you? What if clarity isn’t divine, but brutal? What if it rips things apart just to show you who you really are underneath the pretending? I’ve clawed through anxiety attacks, sat in rooms full of people feeling like a ghost, stared at ceilings wondering if this is all life has to offer — and for what? A maybe? A whisper of “this could be it”? I’m tired of pretending that I’m on some hero’s journey when half the time I don’t even know if I’m facing the right direction. People say “trust the process” — but what if the process is hollow? What if all I’ve been doing is walking in circles, mistaking survival for growth? What if all this searching has cost me things I’ll never get back — time, people, love? Maybe clarity didn't take her from me. Maybe I did, chasing something that never loved me back. And yeah, maybe you didn’t come here for this. But guess what? Neither did I. I didn’t sit down planning to bleed onto a screen, but here we are. If this reads like madness, good. That’s what it feels like. If it resonates, even better. Misery loves company — but maybe clarity does too.</p>

      <p>I think the cruelest part about chasing clarity is realizing that the search itself becomes your cage. You spend years trying to “figure things out” and one day you wake up and realize — you’ve built a life out of uncertainty. And somehow, it still feels safer than choosing anything at all.

They don’t tell you that clarity doesn’t arrive like some divine revelation. It’s more like a breakdown in a parking lot. It’s crying in silence because you're too exhausted to explain the chaos inside your head — again. It's pretending you're okay in front of people who wouldn’t notice if you vanished tomorrow.</p>

      <p>I’ve spent so much time convincing myself that I’m just “figuring it out,” when really, I’ve just been afraid. Afraid to pick a direction, because then I have to admit I’m responsible for where I end up. Afraid to commit, because what if I get it wrong — again? So I stay in limbo. Paralysis dressed up as introspection.

And maybe I did lose her because of this. Not because I didn’t care, but because I couldn’t see. I was too lost in the fog, too busy searching for answers that didn’t exist, to recognize the one thing that was real. And now I carry that — not like a wound, but like a scar I keep reopening just to feel something. <br> <br>So yeah, maybe this isn’t clarity. Maybe it’s just acceptance, dressed in cynicism. But at least it’s honest. At least it’s mine.</p>

      <p style="color:gray; font-size:10pt;">May 18, 2025</p>
      <p>The thing about clarity is, the more you chase it, the faster it slips through your fingers. Like smoke. Or like that feeling right before a panic attack — where you almost understand what's wrong but can’t quite name it. Clarity isn't something you think your way into. You do your way into it. It arrives somewhere between making mistakes, cleaning up after them, and accidentally creating something meaningful while you were just trying to stay sane.</p>
      <p>I used to believe that if I just sat with my thoughts long enough, dissected every emotion, overanalyzed every word, I’d arrive at some divine truth. But all that ever gave me was decision paralysis. The more you contemplate every possible outcome, the less capable you become of actually doing anything. It's like mental quicksand — the harder you struggle to find a foothold, the deeper you sink. I came across this line in the Bhagvad Gita, and it goes like:</p>

      <p style="text-align: center; width: 60%; margin: 2em auto; font-weight:bold; text-shadow: 0 0 1px #fced00, 0 0 10px #fced00, 0 0 20px #fced00;"><em>tasmād asaktaḥ satataṁ  <br>kāryaṁ karma samācara । <br>asakto hy ācaran karma <br> param āpnoti pūruṣaḥ ॥ १९ ॥ </em></p>

      <p><b>Translation:</b> Therefore, without being attached to the fruits of activities, one should act as a matter of duty, for by working without attachment one attains the Supreme. <br> <br>What is the meaning to this? It means that I never really have any control over what happens. Even if I make sure everything goes a certain way, to the best of my will and power, there will always be a probability that I'll fuck it up. There are higher powers that influence the outcome of any action. Expecting things to work out a certain way, is basically, pointless. I know it sounds absurd, but it's the truth. We have very little control over our own bodies, let alone the outcomes of our actions. The only thing I can actually control, under my own jurisdiction, are my actions, and my choices. I shall suffer, or enjoy the consequences of my choices. That's literally all I can do.</p> 
      <p>See, I don’t have control over most things — not how people see me, not whether I get the job, not whether she comes back, not even if this blog ever reaches a soul who needs it. All I can do is act. Do what feels right, true, and necessary.
But without clinging to the results. Sounds noble, right? Like, zen monk kinda noble. But let's be real, detachment is the last thing you're gonna want to try. It's all pretty pleasing to read on the screen, but practically, it's a whole different ball game. <br> <br> I mean, how do you invest years into something -- a dream, a relationship, your magnum opus, and NOT CARE how it ends???? <br> How do you work your ASS off, and <em>not get gutted</em> when the results don't pay off? <br>How do you give, without wanting something, <em>anything</em> back? <br> <br>It’s against everything we’re conditioned to believe. We’re told to hustle for reward. To earn love. To chase success. To always want more. But what if wanting more is what keeps us from peace? What if the chase itself is the cage? Such is the paradoxical nature of this divine comedy. <b style="text-shadow:0 0 1px #fff, 0 0 15px #f0f0f0, 0 0 25px #f0f0f0">This isn't nihilism, it's elevated realism.</b> The kind of realism that understands: you don't get to control the story, you're just the pen. And the sooner you realize that, the sooner you free yourself from the anxiety of outcomes.</p> 
      <p>But that doesn't mean you stop writing. It means you still need to show up everyday. You still wake up, mess up, try again. That's the entire concept of karma. You do you, and you hope for the best, and expect nothing in return. The only thing that actually belongs to you in this mess of a world, is what you choose to do next. And that's the clarity I can live with.</p>
