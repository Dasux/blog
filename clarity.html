      <p>Everyone talks about finding clarity like it's some hidden shrine on a mountain. But what they don't tell you is that most days, it's just fog with better lighting. I've been chasing clarity for as long as I knew the meaning of the word, and I still haven't found it yet. And you know what the problem is? It's this mentality, that clarity is a destination, when it's actually the entire road you take to your goals. </p>
      <p>People expect clarity to be tidy, like something you can write in a planner. But the truth is, most of it comes thru heartbreaks, failures, and caffeine-fueled sirals at 3am. </p>

      <p>The thing about clarity is, you start to lose it the more you think about it. But you get more of it when you start to do things. If you over-contemplate things, and focus on the problems, chances are, you'll end up with less clarity and more confusion than you started. I read this quote in the Bhagavad Gita, and it goes like this... </p><p style="text-align: center; width: 60%; margin: 2em auto;"><em>tasmād asaktaḥ satataṁ <br>kāryaṁ karma samācara <br>asakto hy ācaran karma <br> param āpnoti pūruṣaḥ</em></p>
      <p><b>Translation:</b> Therefore, without being attached to the fruits of activities, one should act as a matter of duty, for by working without attachment one attains the Supreme. </p>
