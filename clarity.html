      <p>everyone talks about finding clarity like it's some hidden shrine on a mountain. but what they don't tell you is that most days, it's just fog with better lighting. i've been chasing clarity for as long as i knew the meaning of the word, and i still haven't found it yet. and you know what the problem is? it's this mentality, that clarity is a destination, when it's actually the entire road you take to your goals.</p>
      
      <p>people expect clarity to be tidy, like something you can write in a planner. but the truth is, most of it comes thru heartbreaks, failures, and caffeine-fueled sirals at 3am. maybe, just maybe, i was never meant to find it. maybe all of this was designed to be lived the way it is; maybe the entire concept of chasing clarity and purpose is a waste of time. i could go on for hours venting out my nihilism, but that wouldn't get me to a conclusion now would it? maybe, this pursuit of clarity, made me lose the love of my life. i dont know if any of this makes any sense to you, and i don't care frankly. you didn't come here to make sense out of life. you came here, maybe cause you stumbled upon this site. maybe i shared the link to you (which would be very... very rare), but you didn't come here to make sense out of things. chances are, you relate to my senseless rant. chances are, you too are seeking clarity. if you do find it, let me know. you know where to find me.</p>

      <p>maybe clarity isn’t a moment of sudden understanding — maybe it’s just a series of quiet, stubborn decisions made in the middle of confusion. maybe it’s the voice that tells you to keep moving, even when your feet are dragging through emotional molasses. no one tells you that clarity can be ugly. that it can look like giving up on a dream that no longer feels like yours. that it might mean walking away from someone you thought you'd grow old with. that sometimes, it's choosing yourself in the least aesthetic, least instagrammable way possible. i used to think clarity would come wrapped in peace. but lately, i think it comes with discomfort — with crying in showers, writing cryptic notes to yourself, and waking up to the realization that you’ve outgrown who you used to be. and if that’s the case, maybe i’ve been closer to clarity than i thought. maybe you have too.</p>

      <p>but let’s be honest — clarity is a scam. it’s the adult version of santa claus. a lie sold to us in productivity podcasts and pinterest quotes. everyone acts like it’s this shining light at the end of the tunnel, but what if the light’s just another train coming to hit you? what if clarity isn’t divine, but brutal? what if it rips things apart just to show you who you really are underneath the pretending? i’ve clawed through anxiety attacks, sat in rooms full of people feeling like a ghost, stared at ceilings wondering if this is all life has to offer — and for what? a maybe? a whisper of “this could be it”? i’m tired of pretending that i’m on some hero’s journey when half the time i don’t even know if i’m facing the right direction. people say “trust the process” — but what if the process is hollow? what if all i’ve been doing is walking in circles, mistaking survival for growth? what if all this searching has cost me things i’ll never get back — time, people, love? maybe clarity didn't take her from me. maybe i did, chasing something that never loved me back. and yeah, maybe you didn’t come here for this. but guess what? neither did i. i didn’t sit down planning to bleed onto a screen, but here we are. if this reads like madness, good. that’s what it feels like. if it resonates, even better. misery loves company — but maybe clarity does too.</p>

      <p>i think the cruelest part about chasing clarity is realizing that the search itself becomes your cage. you spend years trying to “figure things out” and one day you wake up and realize — you’ve built a life out of uncertainty. and somehow, it still feels safer than choosing anything at all. they don’t tell you that clarity doesn’t arrive like some divine revelation. it’s more like a breakdown in a parking lot. it’s crying in silence because you're too exhausted to explain the chaos inside your head — again. it's pretending you're okay in front of people who wouldn’t notice if you vanished tomorrow.</p>

      <p>i’ve spent so much time convincing myself that i’m just “figuring it out,” when really, i’ve just been afraid. afraid to pick a direction, because then i have to admit i’m responsible for where i end up. afraid to commit, because what if i get it wrong — again? so i stay in limbo. paralysis dressed up as introspection. and maybe i did lose her because of this. not because i didn’t care, but because i couldn’t see. i was too lost in the fog, too busy searching for answers that didn’t exist, to recognize the one thing that was real. and now i carry that — not like a wound, but like a scar i keep reopening just to feel something. <br> <br> so yeah, maybe this isn’t clarity. maybe it’s just acceptance, dressed in cynicism. but at least it’s honest. at least it’s mine.</p>

      <p>The thing about clarity is, you start to lose it the more you think about it. But you get more of it when you start to do things. If you over-contemplate things, and focus on the problems, chances are, you'll end up with less clarity and more confusion than you started. I read this quote in the Bhagavad Gita, and it goes like this... </p><p style="text-align: center; width: 60%; margin: 2em auto;"><em>tasmād asaktaḥ satataṁ <br>kāryaṁ karma samācara <br>asakto hy ācaran karma <br> param āpnoti pūruṣaḥ</em></p>
      <p><b>Translation:</b> Therefore, without being attached to the fruits of activities, one should act as a matter of duty, for by working without attachment one attains the Supreme. <br> <br>What is the meaning to this? It means that I never really have any control over what happens. Even if I make sure everything goes a certain way, to the best of my will and power, there will always be a probability that I'll fuck it up. There are higher powers that influence the outcome of any action. This isn't nihilism, this is elevated realism. Expecting things to work out a certain way, is basically, pointless. I know it sounds absurd, but it's the truth. We have very little control over our own bodies, let alone the outcomes of our actions. The only thing I can actually control, under my own jurisdiction, are my actions, and my choices. I shall suffer, or enjoy the consequences of my choices. That's literally all I can do. </p>
      <p>But does that mean I shouldn't do anything at all? No! I should detach myself from the outcomes. It is easier to type it out, than in practice. A hell of a lot easier. Detachment is a virtue many men strive to achieve, but fail desperately. I mean, how can you not detach yourself from the rewards of your actions? If I invest in a share, I will be expecting some returns at the end of the fiscal year. It's unnatural to not expect the outcomes of your deeds, especially your good ones, deeds that you think will bring you prosperity. And yet, that is the sole cause of our downfall. Such is the paradoxical nature of this divine comedy. </p>
