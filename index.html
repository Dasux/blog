        <h3>Congratulations on Finding this blog!</h3> <br>  
        
        <h2>Why does this blog exist?</h2>
      <p>There is something oddly comforting about yelling your thoughts into a blog noone reads. It's like being on the radio in an apocalypse. This is one such blog, for me to yell my unfiltered thoughts, processing my existential cirsises at the break of dawn. <br> <br> Life is pretty fast, it's all over before you can catch up. I thought it would be better to document shit that happens in my life, because I keep forgetting things that I should remember.</p> 

      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      <p>Just your average engineering undergrad, struggling with the overburdening weight of academics, responsibilities, social anxiety and lack of clarity.</p>
